Chapter 6: Tools — From Definition to Execution

The Nervous System

Chapter 5 showed you the agent loop — the while(true) that streams model responses, collects tool calls, and feeds results back. The loop is the heartbeat. But the heartbeat is meaningless without the nervous system that translates “the model wants to run git status” into an actual shell command, with permission checks, result budgeting, and error handling.

The tool system is that nervous system. It spans 40+ tool implementations, a centralized registry with feature-flag gating, a 14-step execution pipeline, a permission resolver with seven modes, and a streaming executor that starts tools before the model finishes its response.

Every tool call in Claude Code — every file read, every shell command, every grep, every sub-agent dispatch — flows through the same pipeline. The uniformity is the point: whether the tool is a built-in Bash executor or a third-party MCP server, it gets the same validation, the same permission checks, the same result budgeting, the same error classification.

The Tool interface has approximately 45 members. That sounds overwhelming, but only five matter for understanding how the system works:

call() — execute the tool

inputSchema — validate and parse the input

isConcurrencySafe() — can this run in parallel?

checkPermissions() — is this allowed?

validateInput() — does this input make semantic sense?

Everything else — the 12 rendering methods, the analytics hooks, the search hints — exists to support the UI and telemetry layers. Start with the five, and the rest falls into place.

The Tool Interface

Three Type Parameters

Every tool is parameterized over three types:

Tool<Input extends AnyObject, Output, P extends ToolProgressData>

Input is a Zod object schema that serves double duty: it generates the JSON Schema sent to the API (so the model knows what parameters to provide), and it validates the model’s response at runtime via safeParse. Output is the TypeScript type of the tool’s result. P is the progress event type the tool emits while running — BashTool emits stdout chunks, GrepTool emits match counts, AgentTool emits sub-agent transcripts.

buildTool() and Fail-Closed Defaults

No tool definition directly constructs a Tool object. Every tool passes through buildTool(), a factory that spreads a defaults object under the tool-specific definition:

// Pseudocode — illustrates the fail-closed defaults pattern
const SAFE_DEFAULTS = {
  isEnabled:         () => true,
  isParallelSafe:    () => false,   // Fail-closed: new tools run serially
  isReadOnly:        () => false,   // Fail-closed: treated as writes
  isDestructive:     () => false,
  checkPermissions:  (input) => ({ behavior: 'allow', updatedInput: input }),
}

function buildTool(definition) {
  return { ...SAFE_DEFAULTS, ...definition }  // Definition overrides defaults
}

The defaults are deliberately fail-closed where it matters for safety. A new tool that forgets to implement isConcurrencySafe defaults to false — it runs serially, never in parallel. A tool that forgets isReadOnly defaults to false — the system treats it as a write operation. A tool that forgets toAutoClassifierInput returns an empty string — the auto-mode security classifier skips it, which means the general permission system handles it instead of an automated bypass.

The one default that is not fail-closed is checkPermissions, which returns allow. This seems backwards until you understand the layered permission model: checkPermissions is tool-specific logic that runs after the general permission system has already evaluated rules, hooks, and mode-based policies. A tool returning allow from checkPermissions is saying “I have no tool-specific objection” — it is not granting blanket access. The grouping into sub-objects (options, named fields like readFileState) provides the structure that focused interfaces would provide, without the ceremony of declaring, implementing, and threading five separate interface types through 40+ call sites.

Concurrency Is Input-Dependent

The signature isConcurrencySafe(input: z.infer<Input>): boolean takes the parsed input because the same tool can be safe for some inputs and unsafe for others. BashTool is the canonical example: ls -la is read-only and concurrency-safe, but rm -rf /tmp/build is not. The tool parses the command, classifies each subcommand against known-safe sets, and returns true only when every non-neutral part is a search or read operation.

The ToolResult Return Type

Every call() returns a ToolResult<T>:

type ToolResult<T> = {
  data: T
  newMessages?: (UserMessage | AssistantMessage | AttachmentMessage | SystemMessage)[]
  contextModifier?: (context: ToolUseContext) => ToolUseContext
}

data is the typed output that gets serialized into the API’s tool_result content block. newMessages lets a tool inject additional messages into the conversation — AgentTool uses this to append sub-agent transcripts. contextModifier is a function that mutates the ToolUseContext for subsequent tools — this is how EnterPlanMode switches the permission mode. Context modifiers are only honored for non-concurrency-safe tools; if your tool runs in parallel, its modifier is queued until the batch completes.

ToolUseContext: The God Object

ToolUseContext is the massive context bag threaded through every tool call. It has approximately 40 fields. It is, by any reasonable definition, a god object. It exists because the alternative is worse.

A tool like BashTool needs the abort controller, the file state cache, the app state, the message history, the tool set, MCP connections, and half a dozen UI callbacks. Threading these as individual parameters would produce function signatures with 15+ arguments. The pragmatic solution is a single context object, grouped by concern:

Configuration (options sub-object): The tool set, model name, MCP connections, debug flags. Set once at query start, mostly immutable.

Execution state: The abortController for cancellation, readFileState for the LRU file cache, messages for the full conversation history. These change during execution.

UI callbacks: setToolJSX, addNotification, requestPrompt. Only wired in interactive (REPL) contexts. SDK and headless modes leave them undefined.

Agent context: agentId, renderedSystemPrompt (frozen parent prompt for fork sub-agents — re-rendering could diverge due to feature flag warm-up and bust the cache).

The sub-agent variant of ToolUseContext is particularly revealing. When createSubagentContext() builds a context for a child agent, it makes deliberate choices about which fields to share and which to isolate: setAppState becomes a no-op for async agents, localDenialTracking gets a fresh object, contentReplacementState is cloned from the parent. Each choice encodes a lesson learned from a production bug.

The Registry

getAllBaseTools(): The Single Source of Truth

The function getAllBaseTools() returns the exhaustive list of every tool that could exist in the current process. Always-present tools come first, then conditionally-included tools gated by feature flags:

const SleepTool = feature('PROACTIVE') || feature('KAIROS')
  ? require('./tools/SleepTool/SleepTool.js').SleepTool
  : null

The feature() import from bun:bundle is resolved at bundle time. When feature('AGENT_TRIGGERS') is statically false, the bundler eliminates the entire require() call — dead code elimination that keeps the binary small.

assembleToolPool(): Merging Built-in and MCP Tools

The final tool set that reaches the model comes from assembleToolPool():

Get built-in tools (with deny-rule filtering, REPL mode hiding, and isEnabled() checks)

Filter MCP tools by deny rules

Sort each partition alphabetically by name

Concatenate built-ins (prefix) + MCP tools (suffix)

The sort-then-concatenate approach is not aesthetic preference. The API server places a prompt-cache breakpoint after the last built-in tool. A flat sort across all tools would interleave MCP tools into the built-in list, and adding or removing an MCP tool would shift built-in tool positions, invalidating the cache.

The 14-Step Execution Pipeline

The function checkPermissionsAndCallTool() is where intent becomes action. Every tool call passes through these 14 steps.

Steps 1-4: Validation

Tool Lookup falls back to getAllBaseTools() for alias matches, handling transcripts from older sessions where a tool was renamed. Abort Check prevents wasted computation on tool calls queued before Ctrl+C propagated. Zod Validation catches type mismatches; for deferred tools, the error appends a hint to call ToolSearch first. Semantic Validation goes beyond schema conformance — FileEditTool rejects no-op edits, BashTool blocks standalone sleep when MonitorTool is available.

Steps 5-6: Preparation

Speculative Classifier Start kicks off the auto-mode security classifier in parallel for Bash commands, shaving hundreds of milliseconds off the common path. Input Backfill clones the parsed input and adds derived fields (expanding ~/foo.txt to absolute paths) for hooks and permissions, preserving the original for transcript stability.

Steps 7-9: Permission

PreToolUse Hooks are the extension mechanism — they can make permission decisions, modify inputs, inject context, or stop execution entirely. Permission Resolution bridges hooks and the general permission system: if a hook already decided, that is final; otherwise canUseTool() triggers rule matching, tool-specific checks, mode-based defaults, and interactive prompts. Permission Denied Handling builds an error message and executes PermissionDenied hooks.

Steps 10-14: Execution and Cleanup

Tool Execution runs the actual call() with the original input. Result Budgeting persists oversized output to ~/.claude/tool-results/{hash}.txt and replaces it with a preview. PostToolUse Hooks can modify MCP output or block continuation. New Messages are appended (sub-agent transcripts, system reminders). Error Handling classifies errors for telemetry, extracts safe strings from potentially mangled names, and emits OTel events.

The Permission System

Seven Modes

ModeBehaviordefaultTool-specific checks; prompt user for unrecognized operationsacceptEditsAuto-allow file edits; prompt for other operationsplanRead-only — deny all write operationsdontAskAuto-deny anything that would normally prompt (background agents)bypassPermissionsAllow everything without promptingautoUse the transcript classifier to decide (feature-flagged)bubbleInternal mode for sub-agents that escalate to the parent

The Resolution Chain

When a tool call reaches permission resolution:

Hook decision: If a PreToolUse hook already returned allow or deny, that is final.

Rule matching: Three rule sets — alwaysAllowRules, alwaysDenyRules, alwaysAskRules — match on tool name and optional content patterns. Bash(git *) matches any Bash command starting with git.

Tool-specific check: The tool’s checkPermissions() method. Most return passthrough.

Mode-based default: bypassPermissions allows everything. plan denies writes. dontAsk denies prompts.

Interactive prompt: In default and acceptEdits modes, unresolved decisions show a prompt.

Auto-mode classifier: A two-stage classifier (fast model, then extended thinking for ambiguous cases).

The safetyCheck variant has a classifierApprovable boolean: .claude/ and .git/ edits are classifierApprovable: true (unusual but sometimes legitimate), while Windows path bypass attempts are classifierApprovable: false (almost always adversarial).

Permission Rules and Matching

Permission rules are stored as PermissionRule objects with three parts: a source tracing provenance (userSettings, projectSettings, localSettings, cliArg, policySettings, session, etc.), a ruleBehavior (allow, deny, ask), and a ruleValue with the tool name and optional content pattern.

The ruleContent field enables fine-grained matching. Bash(git *) allows any Bash command starting with git. Edit(/src/**) allows edits only within /src. Fetch(domain:example.com) allows fetching from a specific domain. Rules without ruleContent match all invocations of that tool.

BashTool’s permission matcher parses the command via parseForSecurity() (a bash AST parser) and splits compound commands into subcommands. If AST parsing fails (complex syntax with heredocs or nested subshells), the matcher returns () => true — fail-safe, meaning the hook always runs. The assumption is that if the command is too complex to parse, it is too complex to confidently exclude from safety checks.

Bubble Mode for Sub-Agents

Sub-agents in coordinator-worker patterns cannot show permission prompts — they have no terminal. The bubble mode causes permission requests to propagate up to the parent context. The coordinator agent, running in the main thread with terminal access, handles the prompt and sends the decision back down.

Tool Deferred Loading

Tools with shouldDefer: true are sent to the API with defer_loading: true — names and descriptions but not full parameter schemas. This reduces initial prompt size. To use a deferred tool, the model must first call ToolSearchTool to load its schema. The failure mode is instructive: calling a deferred tool without loading it causes Zod validation to fail (all typed parameters arrive as strings), and the system appends a targeted recovery hint.

Deferred loading also improves cache hit rates: tools sent with defer_loading: true contribute only their name to the prompt, so adding or removing a deferred MCP tool changes the prompt by a few tokens rather than hundreds.

Result Budgeting

Per-Tool Size Limits

Each tool declares maxResultSizeChars:

ToolmaxResultSizeCharsRationaleBashTool30,000Enough for most useful outputFileEditTool100,000Diffs can be large but the model needs themGrepTool100,000Search results with context lines add up fastFileReadToolInfinitySelf-bounds via its own token limits; persisting would create circular Read loops

When a result exceeds the threshold, the full content is saved to disk and replaced with a <persisted-output> wrapper containing a preview and file path. The model can then use Read to access the full output if needed.

Per-Conversation Aggregate Budget

Beyond per-tool limits, ContentReplacementState tracks an aggregate budget across the entire conversation, preventing death by a thousand cuts — many tools each returning 90% of their individual limit can still overwhelm the context window.

Individual Tool Highlights

BashTool: The Most Complex Tool

BashTool is the system’s most complex tool by far. It parses compound commands, classifies subcommands as read-only or write, manages background tasks, detects image output by magic bytes, and implements a sed simulation for safe edit previews.

The compound command parsing is particularly interesting. splitCommandWithOperators() breaks a command like cd /tmp && mkdir build && ls build into individual subcommands. Each is classified against known-safe command sets (BASH_SEARCH_COMMANDS, BASH_READ_COMMANDS, BASH_LIST_COMMANDS). A compound command is read-only only if ALL non-neutral parts are safe. The neutral set (echo, printf) is ignored — they do not make a command read-only, but they also do not make it write-only.

The sed simulation (_simulatedSedEdit) deserves special attention. When a user approves a sed command in the permission dialog, the system pre-computes the result by running the sed command in a sandbox and capturing the output. The pre-computed result is injected into the input as _simulatedSedEdit. When call() executes, it applies the edit directly, bypassing shell execution. This guarantees that what the user previewed is exactly what gets written — not a re-execution that might produce different results if the file changed between preview and execution.

FileEditTool: Staleness Detection

FileEditTool integrates with readFileState, the LRU cache of file contents and timestamps maintained across the conversation. Before applying an edit, it checks whether the file has been modified since the model last read it. If the file is stale — modified by a background process, another tool, or the user — the edit is rejected with a message telling the model to re-read the file first.

The fuzzy matching in findActualString() handles the common case where the model gets whitespace slightly wrong. It normalizes whitespace and quote styles before matching, so an edit targeting old_string with trailing spaces still matches the file’s actual content. The replace_all flag enables bulk replacements; without it, non-unique matches are rejected, requiring the model to provide enough context to identify a single location.

FileReadTool: The Versatile Reader

FileReadTool is the only built-in tool with maxResultSizeChars: Infinity. If Read output were persisted to disk, the model would need to Read the persisted file, which could itself exceed the limit, creating an infinite loop. The tool instead self-bounds via token estimation and truncates at the source.

The tool is remarkably versatile: it reads text files with line numbers, images (returning base64 multimodal content blocks), PDFs (via extractPDFPages()), Jupyter notebooks (via readNotebook()), and directories (falling back to ls). It blocks dangerous device paths (/dev/zero, /dev/random, /dev/stdin) and handles macOS screenshot filename quirks (U+202F narrow no-break space vs regular space in “Screen Shot” filenames).

GrepTool: Pagination via head_limit

GrepTool wraps ripGrep() and adds a pagination mechanism via head_limit. The default is 250 entries — enough for useful results but small enough to avoid context bloat. When truncation occurs, the response includes appliedLimit: 250, signaling the model to use offset on the next call to paginate. An explicit head_limit: 0 disables the limit entirely.

GrepTool automatically excludes six VCS directories (.git, .svn, .hg, .bzr, .jj, .sl). Searching inside .git/objects is almost never what the model wants, and accidental inclusion of binary pack files would blow through token budgets.

AgentTool and Context Modifiers

AgentTool spawns sub-agents that run their own query loops. Its call() returns newMessages containing the sub-agent’s transcript, and optionally a contextModifier that propagates state changes back to the parent. Because AgentTool is not concurrency-safe by default, multiple Agent tool calls in a single response run serially — each sub-agent’s context modifier is applied before the next sub-agent starts. In coordinator mode, the pattern inverts: the coordinator dispatches sub-agents for independent tasks, and the isAgentSwarmsEnabled() check unlocks parallel agent execution.

How Tools Interact with the Message History

Tool results do not simply return data to the model. They participate in the conversation as structured messages.

The API expects tool results as ToolResultBlockParam objects that reference the original tool_use block by ID. Most tools serialize to text. FileReadTool can serialize to image content blocks (base64-encoded) for multimodal responses. BashTool detects image output by inspecting magic bytes in stdout and switches to image blocks accordingly.

ToolResult.newMessages is how tools extend the conversation beyond the simple call-and-response pattern. Agent transcripts: AgentTool injects the sub-agent’s message history as attachment messages. System reminders: Memory tools inject system messages that appear after the tool result — visible to the model on the next turn but stripped at the normalizeMessagesForAPI boundary. Attachment messages: Hook results, additional context, and error details carry structured metadata that the model can reference in subsequent turns.

The contextModifier function is the mechanism for tools that change the execution environment. When EnterPlanMode executes, it returns a modifier that sets the permission mode to 'plan'. When ExitWorktree executes, it modifies the working directory. These modifiers are the only way for a tool to affect subsequent tools — direct mutation of ToolUseContext is not possible because the context is spread-copied before each tool call. The serial-only restriction is enforced by the orchestration layer: if two concurrent tools both modify the working directory, which wins?

Apply This: Designing a Tool System

Fail-closed defaults. New tools should be conservative until explicitly marked otherwise. A developer who forgets to set a flag gets the safe behavior, not the dangerous one.

Input-dependent safety. isConcurrencySafe(input) and isReadOnly(input) take the parsed input because the same tool at different inputs has different safety profiles. A tool registry that marks BashTool as “always serial” is correct but wasteful.

Layer your permissions. Tool-specific checks, rule-based matching, mode-based defaults, interactive prompts, and automated classifiers each handle different cases. No single mechanism is sufficient.

Budget results, not just inputs. Token limits on input are standard. But tool results can be arbitrarily large and they accumulate across turns. Per-tool limits prevent individual explosions. Aggregate conversation limits prevent cumulative overflow.

Make error classification telemetry-safe. In minified builds, error.constructor.name is mangled. The classifyToolError() function extracts the most informative safe string available — telemetry-safe messages, errno codes, stable error names — without ever logging the raw error message to analytics.

What Comes Next

This chapter traced how a single tool call flows from definition through validation, permission, execution, and result budgeting. But the model rarely requests just one tool at a time. How tools are orchestrated into concurrent batches is the subject of Chapter 7.
